# 💼 Data Professionals Survey Analysis

## 📌 Introduction
This Power BI dashboard dives into the world of data professionals exploring their work-life balance, salary trends, favourite programming languages, and much more. It’s an attempt to understand what the data life truly looks like, beyond just code and dashboards.

The visuals bring together survey responses from professionals across the globe and aim to shed light on the joys, challenges, and realities of working in the data domain.

## 🎯 Background
The survey data was originally conducted and shared by a YouTuber. I decided to work on this dataset because, let's be honest, I don’t know that many people, and even if I did, getting so many responses would be a dream. So instead of sending a Google Form into the void, I picked up a solid dataset with enough responses to draw real insights.

## 🛠️ Tools I Used
Power Query to clean and prepare the raw data for analysis

DAX functions to create calculated measures and KPIs

Power BI Desktop for building the entire interactive dashboard and visual storytelling

## 🔍 The Analysis
Here’s what the dashboard explores:

Work-Life Balance: Are data professionals happy with their current balance?

Favourite Programming Languages: Which tools dominate the data space?

Breaking Into Tech: How hard did professionals find it to land their first job in data?

Average Salary by Job Title: See how roles like Data Analyst, Scientist, and Engineer compare

The dashboard allows users to filter by region, job title, and more to drill down into the numbers that matter most.

## 💡 What I Learned
I definitely optimized my Power BI skills and got hands-on with:

Structuring data with Power Query

Writing clean, reusable DAX measures

Designing user-friendly and insightful dashboards

This project helped me move from just “knowing” Power BI to feeling comfortable building full projects in it.

## 📈 The Conclusion
This dashboard could be super helpful for aspiring data professionals. By looking at the real-life experiences of people already in the field and the salaries, challenges, preferences ultimetly you can decide:

If data is your thing

What to expect in the journey

How to plan your path based on others’ insights

Think of it as a sneak peek into the life you might want to build backed by data.
